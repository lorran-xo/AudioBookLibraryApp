## Summary ##
This is a personal React Native project of an Audio Book app for Android & iOS. 

###### NOTE: Initially the data was being retrieved using the [LibriVox API](https://librivox.org/api/info) - but I had to mock most of the data otherwise the app would crash because most of the data from the API is unavailable / not stored anymore. But the app works for it's main purpose anyways.

## The app ##
The app is still in progress as it can be seen in this [Project Kanban](https://github.com/users/lorran-xo/projects/2/views/1).
